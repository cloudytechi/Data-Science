## What does a Data Scientist do?

#### Understand the Problem
Data Scientists should be aware of the business pain points and ask the right questions.

#### Collect Data
They need to collect enough data to understand the problem in hand and to better solve it in terms of time, money, and resources.

#### Process the Raw Data
Data is rarely used in its original form. It must be processed, and there are several ways to convert it into a usable format.

#### Explore the Data
Once the data has been processed and converted into a usable form, Data Scientists must examine it to determine the characteristics and find out obvious trends, correlations, and more.

#### Analyze the Data
To understand the data, they use a variety of tool libraries, such as Machine Learning, statistics and probability, linear and logistic regression, time series analysis, and more.

#### Communicate Results
At last, results must be communicated to the right stakeholders, laying the groundwork for all identified issues.
